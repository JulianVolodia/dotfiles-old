Runiq's dotfiles
================

These are my dotfiles. Feel free to copy and paste as you see fit.

Disclaimer
==========

I don't assume liability for any of these files. If you copy and paste and one of the files eats your hamster, you're on your own.

If I have left out a license or improperly attributed something and you want that fixed, drop me a line.

``Deploy`` script
=================

This little devil takes three parameters:

1. Where your dotfiles currently reside (default: ``files``)
2. Where they should be copied to (default: ``~/.config/dotfiles``)
3. What directory you want to put the symlinks in (default: ``~``)

The default values aren't implemented yet.
