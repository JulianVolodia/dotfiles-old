deploy:

* Logging
* Remove stale symlinks (there's a trick involving find:

* Figure out how to save file permissions properly
  (see http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1289816)
* Add ability to create temporary, cache, etc. directories
* Use rsync(?) to monitor changes in config files and add "reploy" ability that
  mirrors changes back into the repository
