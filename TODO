deploy:
=======

* Logging
* Remove stale symlinks (there's a trick involving find:

      find -L . -type l -delete

  Tries to follow symlinks, but if it cannot, the stale symlink matches the
  "-type l" specifier and gets deleted)
* Ignore .orig files in source directory
* Figure out how to save file permissions properly
  (see http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1289816)

* Use rsync(?) to monitor changes in config files and add "reploy" ability that
  mirrors changes back into the repository
