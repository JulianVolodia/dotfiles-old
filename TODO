=======
deploy:
=======

* configparser, logging
* reploy: Transfer changes in *deployed* dotfiles into their repo
  equivalents (e.g. change ~/.zshrc -> reploy -> changes are put into
  <dotfilesrepo>/files/zshrc)

Options:
========

* don't overwrite files with source if target is newer

Zsh:
====

* Figure out how to incorporate virtualenv into path
* Figure out what's going on with ranger:
  * Whenever I'm not in a vcs_info project, the "starting path" after ~
    gets appended again
  * Whenever I'm outside ~, the path just gets stuck at its "starting
    path" value
